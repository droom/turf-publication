            <p class="para brief"><em>A desire path is a route “where the grass is worn thin between the places we find ourselves and the places we would like to be”. Deviating from controlled routes designed by urban planning, property ownership and traffic systems, they symbolise the self-made solutions carved out by communities (human or animal), the wisdom of crowds, intuitive design & rebellious creativity. Desire Paths is Turf Projects’ Croydon London Borough of Culture flagship project and part of Turf’s year exploring the theme ‘DEMYSTIFICATION’. A satellite arts festival across Croydon, the project aims to explore how communities and creatives can shape the spaces and places around them, with a focus on disused and underused spaces around the borough. An artist-led charity founded by Croydon locals in 2013, Turf was set up to provide opportunities & space for creatives locally. Operating in ex-retail spaces in Croydon with an uncertain future due to as-yet-unrealised urban development, the questions we frequently found ourselves asking about who has power over space in our hometown acted as our starting point for Desire Paths;</em></p>
            <ol class="list brief">
               <li><em>How do spaces end up empty? How can we bring them back into use?</em></li>
               <li><em>How can people be more actively involved in these processes, why aren’t they?</em></li>
               <li><em>Who owns space in Croydon? What are the roles of culture, commerce & power in how space is shaped, valued and co-opted?</em></li>
               <li><em>How does rapid change & regeneration impact our sense of wellbeing, stability, belonging & collective memory?</em></li>
               <li><em>How could Croydon forge its own path in determining how spaces and places are used?</em></li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para brief"><em>We wanted to approach these questions with humour, playfulness and curiosity, in an attempt to demystify the processes behind them. Desire Paths will be led by artists, organisations or collectives chosen by open call. The project will start with a symposium event at Turf and then unfold and expand across Croydon via the projects commissioned through this open call.</em></p>

            <p class="para">In 2023 I started <em>Norwood Letters</em>, a research-led design practice, focussed on the local community. This arose from a few themes which have been on my mind for some time:</p>
            <ol class="list">
               <li>Belonging, homelands; the rising-tide of nationalism</li>
               <li>The co-ordinated attacks on education, and the success of anti-intellectualism as a dominant lens for which to understand current and past events</li>
               <li>Environments—in particular relation to mental health and well-being</li>
            </ol>

            <ol class="list">
               <li>To uplift communities</li>
               <li>To share knowledge</li>

            <blockquote class="quote">
               Although great new ideas are usually articulated by individuals, they’re nearly always generated by communities. Being an artist, you hear a lot of talk about genius; which is the process of singling out certain people in art history and saying, “<em>those were the important ones</em>,” ... Whenever you look at any of those artists, you find that they lived and drew from a very, very active, flourishing cultural scene. And they were only one of the elements in that scene. So just as genius is the creative intelligence of an individual, <em>scenius</em> is the creative intelligence of a community.

            <p class="para">Between 2020&ndash;2022 I co-ran a digital co-operative as Design Lead, and played a key role in developing collaborative processes, both for internal and external teams. Many of these were adapted during the pandemic for remote working. Below are some of the methods I would try to apply to working with with large groups in the research and collaboration of creating the publication:</p>
            <ol class="list">
               <li>Using <em>Miro</em> whiteboarding, we can easily generate ideas even with large teams. I had often used this during discovery sessions with clients, the largest meeting being with IPPR, which numbered around 15 people on the call, all contributing.</li>
               <li>I work with <em>Figma</em> which has a feedback tool built-in, and is freely available to use. What I've found works really well is creating lo-fi scamps for layout and rough content, to then be designed in a desktop publisher (For me, InDesign).</li>
               <li>By applying <em>Agile</em> to the design process we can created with structured feedback windows and crits</li>
               <li>Sociocracy in decision-making</li>

            <h3 class="h3">Documentation</h3>
            <p class="para">I think the publication will require careful documentation. I like to keep a cloud-based research documents for every project, which has lots of benefits for collaboration. These documents are always kept orderly and time-stamped, and can be made accessible to anyone working on the project. These house call notes, background research, serve as a record of thinking / decisions made along the way, and ideas to potentially explore at a later date.

I began this project in 2019, making notes and recording stories from my mum which span 1979–1998. In the making of this project, I grew to understand much more about what she went through, the power in storytelling, and the amount of work involved in a project like this. I'm now in contact with novelist David Dabydeen (a writer focussed on indentured labour and migration) and he was kind enough to offer to proof-read the completed first-draft.<br/><br/>Excerpts can be found <a href="pdf/CONTROL_Excerpts.pdf">here</a>.</figcaption>
